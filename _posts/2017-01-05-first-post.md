Hi, I'm Parveen Kaur!
I am currently a Masters Student at the University of British Columbia who also really loves to paint. 
I study data science by day and hues by night (almost literally). You can usually find me nursing a 3 hour old coffee pretending to do homework while actually browsing Pinterest.

Hello!

My name is Parveen Kaur and I am currently a Masters Student at The University of British Columbia, UBC, in the Masters of Data Science Program. I completed my undergraduate degree also at UBC as a Major in Biology. 

You can usually find me nursing a 3 hour old coffee pretending to do assignments while actually browsing Pinterest.


### More Information

I would like to think of myself as an artsy scientist (though one might argue all scientists are creatives). Follow my artistic journey over on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/citrushues/)
